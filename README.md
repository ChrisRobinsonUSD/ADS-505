Purpose:
Estimate the number of potential COVID travel insurance customers before deciding on whether to change insurance carrier at significant risk and cost to the company.

Background:
Competitors have begun offering COVID travel insurance due to the pandemic.  Not all carriers include this coverage and with the COVID situation still not under control some travel companies are deciding to revamp their insurance offerings to include COVID insurance.  Because of the added cost associated with this insurance some companies have adopted a “wait and see” attitude hoping the pandemic will end in the near future.

Current Situation:
The company’s current travel insurance offering does not include coverage for COVID related trip cancellation or medical expenses.  The competitors are starting to offer this coverage and several customers have shown hesitancy to travel due to the risk of cancellation associated with the current COVID situation.                     

Conclusion:
Due to the current COVID situation it is important to be able to offer COVID insurance as an option.  In order to offer this coverage, the company will have to change insurance carriers and sign into a contract in order to make the offering affordable.  Due to the cost and risk associated with the change in carriers it is imperative that the company do their due diligence in estimating the customer response to the new offering before making a decision.
